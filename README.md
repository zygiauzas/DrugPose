## Data availability

Relevant data can be downloaded from PDBBind: http://www.pdbbind.org.cn/ and it should be uploaded to PDBBind folder.

## Models

Each of the model should be downloaded and the individual environments should be set up separately:

- Ligdream: https://github.com/playmolecule/ligdream
- SQUID: https://github.com/keiradams/SQUID
- Pocket2mol: https://github.com/pengxingang/Pocket2Mol

## Processing

### Running the models on the PDBbind
Once the repos are set up you can run the relevant scripts for Ligdream, SQUID and Pocket2mol models, by running the files in generation folder.

### Running the evaluation script
Once the molecules are generated you can run the analysis scripts and specifying the directories in the folder.
